        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>A <strong>taco</strong> is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a <strong>folded or rolled tortilla</strong>—usually made from corn or flour—that is filled with a variety of ingredients. 
            Common fillings include grilled or stewed meats <em>(like beef, chicken, pork, or fish)</em>, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, onions, and guacamole. 
            Tacos are often garnished with cilantro, lime juice, and hot sauces, offering a flavorful and customizable eating experience. 
        </p>
            
        <p>Tacos can be <strong>soft</strong> (with a pliable tortilla) or <strong>crispy</strong> <em>(typically deep-fried or baked)</em>, and they’re popular in both street food and home-cooked settings. 
            With countless regional and modern variations—like tacos al pastor, fish tacos, or breakfast tacos—they’re loved for their versatility, portability, and 
            bold flavors.
